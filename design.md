# Interaction Design

In the Interaction Design Profession at Defra, we are generally agnostic about the tools interaction designers use to get the job done, but when it comes to designing products and services that both citizens and staff use on a day-to-day basis, we prioritise designing in the browser to ensure what we are designing is as close to what we are delivering (and has a very good chance of meeting, where relevant, the [service standard](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-standard) and the [Technology Code of Practise](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/the-technology-code-of-practice). Plus, it goes a long way to ensuring what we design meets the [accessibility regulations](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/accessibility-requirements-for-public-sector-websites-and-apps) that ultimately will impact everything we design.

The regulations aren't there to make our lives difficult, they are there to help us build better products and services.

HTML prototyping is central to how we deliver our design work. Depending on the structure and the way a team is set up, sometimes the design and prototyping workflow will be slightly different and more of the prototyping will be done by a front end developer. Ultimately, it is what is most suitable for the individual team. However, a designer will always be more empowered if they can communicate their ideas through HTML.

Below are some of the activities carried out by Interaction and Service designers in Defra.

### Discovery

How interaction designers support discovery:

* Build knowledge of the subject and understanding of the policy intent (work with stakeholders, policy and subject matter experts)
* Understand how users interact with any current service
* Understand user needs and track interactions across departmental and organisational boundaries
* Help the team to identify and investigate pain points or problems with any existing service
* Capture, document and present holistic user journeys in a clear, engaging way
* Make plans for Alpha ('How might we statements', hypotheses and assumptions to test)
* Work with team and stakeholders to capture the entire perspective of a service, help to set the vision and build a roadmap for the future
 
### Alpha

How interaction designers support the alpha phase:

* Prioritise assumptions identified in discovery for testing
* Facilitate design and mapping workshops with the team
* Design and test multiple solutions to make sure we build the right thing
* Decide on high-level to be user journeys (online, offline etc)
* Iterate and test assumptions through prototyping
* Identify and create reusable patterns and components that can be rolled out across Defra and across government services
* Make sure the service is inclusive and accessible
* Know how to use data and research to influence design thinking

### Beta

How interaction designers support the beta phase:

* Prototype detailed interactions, components, screens
* Iterate designs based on user research, data, analysis and feedback
* Iterate and refine existing design patterns where needed
* Create new design patterns where needed and share with wider Defra and cross government design communities
* Make sure the service can be used by everyone
* Help the team test the service with assistive technology
* Help the team to create a plan for assisted digital users
* Utilise, iterate and introduce interaction patterns and standards that scale

### Live

How interaction designers support live:

* Use feedback, analytics, and call centre data to identify areas for product improvement
* Continue to address any constraints identified in beta
* Work with other organisations that provide services that are part of the same service journey in order to iterate towards solving a whole problem for users
* Iterate and test designs with users

## New features

What is it? - An interaction designer makes sure any additional features are designed to meet user needs, design standards and accessibility legislation. They also make sure new features are aligned to the service vision and add value for users.

An interaction designer will:

* understand how users interact with and are affected by any new feature
* design and test prototypes to make sure new features are usable and inclusive
* create reusable patterns and components that can be rolled out across Defra

## External changes

What is it? - An interaction designer updates products in response to changes in external components, legislation or services that the application depends on.

An interaction designer will:

* understand how changes will impact users
* design and test prototypes to make sure new features are usable and inclusive

## Legacy products/sub-services

What is it? - An interaction designer works on legacy applications making sure products are inline with current design standards and accessibility legislation.

An interaction designer will:

* work with existing product users to improve usability and efficiency
* create designs to test with users working within legacy technology constraints 
* help the teams to understand and meet accessibility legislation

# Service Design

Service designers help to define the scope of the service whether it is a minimal viable product (MVP), a minimal viable service (MVS) or a minimal marketable service (MMS). Together with the product or service manager they will reflect on the identified user needs and figure out what the smallest useful version of the service can be.

And when the time comes, service designers facilitate the design of the service from end to end across all channels both online and offline, from backstage processes and activities to front user-facing products and tasks. This facilitation allows the whole team to be involved and to ensure the best solution is reached.

When mapping a users' journey, a service designer will include a view of an entire system with all of its stakeholders and all of its pain points to ensure they are spotting all opportunities for reducing cost, reducing complexity and reducing the steps for a user to achieve their goal. In the Discovery phase, 90% of a service designer's work is archaeology.
 
## Scoping/shaping

Working with the business and policy upfront to understand what we have, what we might need to do and why. This stage is about establishing the problem/costs/issues that you want to look at. Including the people and skills you are likely to need for discovery. At this stage we need to define the problem(s) and the desired outcome(s).

Questions to answer:

* Who are the users and stakeholders?
* Do we understand their needs?
* What underlying challenges do we need to address?
* What already exists internally/ externally?
* What do we want to achieve?
* How might this link to the wider digital strategy?
* What areas might we need to look into in more detail?
* What is the scope we want to explore in discovery?

### Workshops

A Service Designer will:

* Facilitate sessions involving key stakeholders/ users
* Understand and frame the problems you want to solve
* Help you sketch out a vision
* Create an agreed set of outcomes

### Design sprints / UCD policy design
 
Understand the policy intent and the needs of users to help design the policy and generate ideas for how it might be enacted.
 
A Service Designer will:
 
* Conduct initial stakeholder/ user exploration
* Document insights
* Facilitate idea generation
* Run co-design sessions to test and build on hypotheses
* Create prototypes to test policy

### Exploration

Working alongside policy, business analysis and architecture to understand the main business drivers, problems to be solved and desired outcomes before moving to Discovery. 

A Service Designer will:

* Identify the main business drivers 
* Gather existing insight about the users of any current service and high level pain points 
* Gather existing insight about user needs
* Identify subject matter experts and key stakeholders
* Align proposed work to strategy and programme vision
* Work with Policy to define the problems we are trying to solve
* Work with Policy to define the outcomes we want to deliver
* Work alongside a Business Analyst to understanding the people, processes and data involved in any as is process
* Analyse failure within services and identify root causes for that failure. Identify opportunities for cost reduction and improvement within an existing service.
* Create as is user journeys, highlighting pain points, dependencies, areas for improvements and hypothesis to test
* Create service prototypes, and design touchpoints
* Work with the team to provide recommendations for how to take the work forward
* Frame and create problem statements for discovery

## New programmes of work
 
Services as end users would know them transcend delivery or product teams. Service designers work across a programme of work to design the interactions and building blocks that make a new service. The service designer may support multiple product teams to provide insight on how to achieve desired outcomes in a measurable way.

A Service Designer will:

* Identify the main business drivers 
* Work with the team to define the problems we are trying to solve
* Work with Policy to define the outcomes we want to deliver
* Create as is user journeys, highlighting pain points, dependencies, areas for improvements and hypothesis to test
* Develop a strategic vision for the service 
* Design the interactions and building blocks that make up the service
* Create service prototypes to test ideas and assumptions
* Influence performance reporting so we measure and target improvements to things that matter to users
* Lead on ensuring that interactions and user journeys across the programme are rational and consistent

## Existing programmes of work

Service designers work with existing programmes to help connect discrete digital projects to deliver a joined up service vision, provide cost efficiencies, and increase the effectiveness with which end-user benefits are delivered.

A Service Designer will:

* Align and lead communication with service managers, product owners and policy colleagues to define user journeys and articulate the vision for products and services 
* Visualise/map existing products and processes, highlighting inconsistencies, inefficiencies, dependencies, pain points and dead ends.
* Visualise/map relationships between different products or sub services
* Identify opportunities for service improvement and cost reduction
* Identify opportunities to align internal processes 
* Identify opportunities to align our services with user journeys and tasks 
* Lead on ensuring that interactions and user journeys across the programme are rational and consistent
* Understand user needs and track interactions across departmental and organisational boundaries 
* Influence performance reporting so we measure and target improvements to things that

## Discovery

How service designers support discovery:

* Question the scope of the discovery – broaden it, rescope it (and if necessary initiate further discovery)
* Keep the team on track for an appropriately wide discovery
* Understand who the users and user groups of the service/system/thing are (primary users, secondary users, internal users)
* Investigate users’ contexts, needs, potential gains, pain points
* Synthesise user research data and share findings back to the wider team and key stakeholders
* Sift through quantitative data and link it to qualitative findings, potentially initiate more
* Research and describe underlying support systems and technologies
* Analyse dependencies (contractual, legal, technological, ethical)
* Map the as-is state of the service offered today
* Map all stakeholders involved in the provision of the service to end users
* Capture what the provision of service in different channels looks like
* Research how much the service costs to operate, who funds it and how and how it is funded today and how it expensive its provision is
* Read policy documents, laws, standards, regulations and question today’s
* Summarise major pain points of users and opportunities for service (re)-development / improvements
* Help the team agree scope and boundaries and decide when is the right time to move into Alpha
* Articulate the vision for the service (with product manager/service owner)

## Alpha

How service designers support the alpha phase:

* Understand and respond to the users of a service and the context they are in
* Identify what the real problem is
* Develop a strategic vision for the service (final destination, not just the plan for beta)
* With the product manager, hold the vision for the team
* Work with team to develop a scaffolded approach to delivering the vision
* Help define problems for interaction designers to explore
* Map and visualise the journey of users
* Facilitate a shared understanding within and outside of the team
* Spot opportunities for reducing cost and complexity
* Help define the scope of the service
* What are the feasible and useful fixes you can do - low hanging fruit where change is feasible, easy and beneficial for the user, and what is harder to do
* Explore and prototype various solutions to the problem

## Beta

How service designers support the beta phase:

* Keep track of user needs as the service is used and help prioritise into fixes, new features and functionality
* Help the service to understand and decide what new usage, contexts and features should be incorporated into digital channels or built into other channels and support systems
* Find and implement improvements to the service in all channels
* Work with caseworkers and support teams to make sure that user’s needs and problems are represented in the development teams, and incorporate feedback that will help caseworkers do their jobs better

## Live

How service designers support live:

* Identify areas for automation or improvement to make internal processes simpler and more efficient
* Identify customer and user behaviours and process for continuously provide feedback to product and service teams
* Provide a holistic view, from digital and physical channels and human interactions and ongoing identification of metrics and opportunities
