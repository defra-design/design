# Design crits

A design crit is a critique, or detailed analysis of something (not a criticism) in order to improve its design. Design crits can be done at any stage in the design process and help improve our services.

We have a [#design-crits](https://defra-digital.slack.com/archives/C01REPJH9V5) slack channel that allows you to submit your work for immediate feedback.

We also offer design crits to anyone who is interested in having them. You can request a design crit session via [our request form](https://forms.gle/nQrFQYzd5sdLjuBK6).


## Why we do design crits

Design crits are about:

* lifting the standard and consistency of design practice across Defra
* creating a sense of collective responsibility for everything that goes out the door in our name
* developing our critical skills as designers: evaluating work and lending a helping hand to our colleagues to improve it
* thinking hard beyond design patterns, about user needs and coherent end-to-end service experiences
* sharing what we learn with the design team and government more widely


## Proposed ground rules for running a design crit

Design crits can be, when badly run, bruising affairs so we propose to follow six important ground rules to make sure it’s all about the work and not the individual. These are proposals and nothing here is fixed in stone - we’ll continue to experiment and find what works best for us as a design team.

1. **Crits are always moderated**

2. **Everything is about the work, never about the individual.** A good critique should be honest and to the point, but never personal.

    As Sarah Richards puts it, we start from the assumption that: *“everyone did the best job they could with the information they had at the time”*

3. **It’s a conversation and not a court.** Crits are a place to start conversations, not to aggressively challenge or criticise people for ‘doing it wrong’.

4. **Be in listening, not defensive mode.** As a designer sharing work, show the work as it is, don’t pre-emptively interpret/explain/defend on its behalf.

5. **Take notes, lots of them.** Someone must take responsibility for capturing the conversation and sharing it.

6. **We don’t have to agree.** Others might say/suggest things that the designer doesn’t agree with or cannot action, but they do have a responsibility to manage expectations and be clear about what they intend to do in response (see 5).


## Tips for getting and giving feedback


### Getting feedback


#### 1. Set the context

* who are the users?
* what do they need?
* what stage is the project at?
* what are our current assumptions?

You can use the [project summary cards](https://github.com/DEFRA/design/raw/master/assets/project-summary-cards.pdf) to help set the context for a crit.


#### 2. Say what kind of feedback you want

* graphic design
* interaction design
* service design
* content design


#### 3. Let the team review the work

* don’t give a demo
* don’t talk too much
* don’t get defensive
* do take notes
* do listen


### Giving feedback


#### 1. Listen to the context

* ask questions if you need to


#### 2. Give the right kind of feedback

* avoid personal opinions
* avoid absolute statements
* ask open questions
* be kind
* explore ideas and suggest alternatives


Instead of:

*“I don’t like X”*  
*“Y never works”*  

Ask:

*“What happens if...”*  
*“Have you tried...”*


You can use the [questions and suggestions form](https://github.com/DEFRA/design/raw/master/assets/questions_and_suggestions.docx) to help provide feedback at a crit.
